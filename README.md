# Natural Language Understanding 
This repo gathers a set of exercises on Natural Language Understanding. 
<br>
Please note that this is not intended as a project, but rather as a block of notes on the topic, which will be enriched as I continue exploring the world of ideas on NLU.
## Vector Space models
The first exercise focuses on Vector Space Models. 
<br>
From the notebook:
> ### But what is our goal? 
> *Ideally* we would like to represent **semantically related words close together** in the vector space, <br>
and semantically unrelated words should end up far apart
``` 
# Usage note: 
if you intend to run the notebook please note that it uses roughly 
1.4 GB of data, which I download and save on my Drive Storage 
in the first cells. If you intend to store the data differently 
you should modify the "Getting the data" section.
```
### Up next in this section: 
1. Re-weighting schemes
2. Subword information
3. Dimensionality Reduction
